- This project is based on predicting the price of an Insurance claims using machine learning Algoritmhs using the real time data of one of the leading medical aid society in Zimbabwe
- The data was splitted into a train and test data set before feature engineering took place
- Initially, EDA was conducted to make sure that the data meets the actual formatings and date categories are cleaned to read as dates.
- Feature engineering was conducted and data cleaning was conducted using some data science algorithms
- The researcher managed to treat missing values by with the meadian values of the data set to enhance normality assumption
- To convert categorical data into strings, onehot-encoding took place on the train data set
- Model evaluation tookl place and the RMSE AND RME were at minimal levels
- After conducting valuation on RF models , predictions were made
