- This project is based on predicting the price of an Insurance claim using ML Algoritmhs
- Data Source (Real time data from one of leading medical aid society in Zimbabwe)


- Data was imported for cleaning and character definitions
- EDA was conducted to make sure that the data meets the actual formatings and date categories are cleaned to read as dates.
- It was splitted into train and test data set before feature engineering took place
- Feature engineering was conducted.
- The researcher managed to treat missing values by with the meadian values of the data set to enhance normality assumption
- To convert categorical data into strings, onehot-encoding took place on the train data set
- Model evaluation was done and the RMSE AND RME were at minimal levels (which determines the eroor levels of the Data sets)
- After conducting valuation on RF models , predictions were made with the tested algorithms
